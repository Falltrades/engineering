# [Cloud Pi Native](https://cloud-pi-native.fr)

This is a platform engineering project designed by the French government.

## Reminder

As you know platform engineering aims to empower developers. Ideally, developers want to be able to focus on solving customers problem by gathering requirements, designing solutions and developing code, without having to worry about complexities of infrastructure and deployment.

## Problem

But we platform engineer are also developers. How can we simplify our work so we can focus on the joy of building ? 
As they often said: _you build it, you run it, and if it can run itself, even better_.

## Solution

We need to break down in simpler sub-problems.
- [How do we convert code to production ?](./gitOps.html)
- [How do we make sure nothing breaks ?](./test.html)
- [How do we deploy new release automatically ?](./workflow.html)

If all 3 questions are answered positively, our main problem will be solved. That's what we're going to do.
